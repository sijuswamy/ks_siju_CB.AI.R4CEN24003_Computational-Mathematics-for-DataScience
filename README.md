## Course Overview

This course introduces fundamental and advanced topics in **linear algebra** and **optimization**, with a focus on their applications in data science and machine learning. Key concepts such as matrix operations, eigenvalue decomposition, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and optimization algorithms are explored. These techniques are then applied in **machine learning** projects that involve real-world data analysis and model development.

## Assignments

The assignments cover a wide range of topics and are solved both mathematically and computationally using **MATLAB**. Each assignment is designed to build a strong foundation in **linear algebra** and **optimization** techniques.

You can find the assignments in the **Assignments** folder:

## Projects

The projects focus on applying the concepts learned in the course to real-world problems. These projects incorporate both **statistical methods** and **machine learning algorithms** to solve practical problems.

You can find the projects in the **Projects** folder:

- [Project 1: Classification of Benign and Malignant Tissue](projects/project1.md)
  - This project involves using both statistical and machine learning algorithms to classify benign and malignant tissue samples. The **CVX solver** is used for optimization tasks within the project.
  
- [Project 2: Digital Image Processing with Singular Value Decomposition](projects/project2.md)
  - This project explores the use of **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** for three important image processing techniques: **image compression**, **denoising**, and **forensics**. It is a partial independent replication of Sadek's work in the field.

For further details and code implementation, visit the respective project files in the **Projects** folder.

## Tools and Libraries

- **MATLAB**: Used for solving optimization problems with the CVX solver.
- **CVX Solver**: A MATLAB-based optimization solver used for modeling and solving convex optimization problems.
- **Python**: Used for some machine learning tasks (if applicable).
